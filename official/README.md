# Voron Official Documentation

This is the primary repository for the 'official' Voron documentation that has been reviewed and approved by the Voron development team.  Everything that is contained in here is fully vetted and supported.

If this is the first time building a Voron printer (especially if this is the first 3D printer), it is strongly suggested to build 100% to spec using the documentation provided here.  The spec configurations have been tested extensively and are well supported.
